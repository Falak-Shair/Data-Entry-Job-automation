# Data-Entry-Job-automation
The project that we're going to be tackling is a data entry job we're going to be trying out using both Beautiful Soup and Selenium in this project.

We're going to be tackling a research data entry job where we're researching house prices that fit a particular criteria for a client on the Zillow 
website. And then we're going to be transferring that data into a form which will create a spreadsheet in Google sheets



# Working :
We're going to go to Zillow, which is one of the largest real estate listing sites in the US we are also going to be using Beautiful Soup to scrape 
through all of this data. And what we want is the price, the address, and also the URL that this will link to
for example,
when I click on this link, it will link it to the actual listing of the place. 

And then once we scrape all of that data using Beautiful Soup, then you are going to be using 
Selenium to autofill in a Google form. So we're going to be adding in the address of the property, the price per month and the link to property.

And once all of that form's been compiled, then you will have the option to turn it into a spreadsheet.
